The lift
--------
What do we need:
1   To set motor speed, floor lights, open door
2   To be able to respond events, such as button presses,
    floor sensors activating, obstructions.
3   But only those events that we care about!
4   Easy testing (I want to run this without an actual elevator!)

How to acheive these:
1   Expose setter functions?
2   Pass in event channels to the module corresponding to
3   the events that we care about. The module performs polling 
    internally, to detect these events, and pushes them onto the
    channels.
4   We should pass in an elevator abstraction to the module.
    We can have one that interfaces with comedilib (the lift
    at the lab), and a fake elevator (the simulator perhaps).
