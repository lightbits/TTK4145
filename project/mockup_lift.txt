The driver
----------
What do we need:
1   To set motor speed, floor lights, open door
2   To be able to respond events, such as button presses,
    floor sensors activating, obstructions.
3   But only those events that we care about!
4   Easy testing (I want to run this without an actual elevator!)

How to acheive these:
1   Expose setter functions?
2   Pass in event channels to the module corresponding to
3   the events that we care about. The module performs polling 
    internally, to detect these events, and pushes them onto the
    channels.
4   We should pass in an elevator abstraction to the module.
    We can have one that interfaces with comedilib (the lift
    at the lab), and a fake elevator (the simulator perhaps).

The lift controller
-------------------
What do we need:
1   Maybe a destination queue
2   A way to tell the main thread when the lift has executed all orders in queue?
3   Add jobs to queue
4   Tell the lift when it passes a floor

How to acheive this:
    The lift controller can be a non-concurrent state machine.
